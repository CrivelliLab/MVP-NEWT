Respiratory:  The patient required intubation and\nventilation shortly after birth.  She was treated with three\ndoses of Surfactant and required mechanical ventilation\nthrough the entire month of [**Month (only) 404**].  She developed no\nevidence of a patent ductus arteriosus.  During the first\nseveral days of life, she required treatment with fluid\nboluses and dopamine infusion to maintain blood pressures in\nthe normal range.  She developed mild metabolic acidosis\nrelated to renal immaturity that required treatment with\nsodium bicarb infusions.\n\n2. Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  Patient received\nparenteral nutrition from the initial days of her\nhospitalization until feeds were started during the middle to\nlatter part of [**Month (only) 956**].  She tolerated the feeding advance\nwell until the end of [**Month (only) 404**] at which time, she developed\nabdominal distention and abnormal KUBs which prompted\ntreatment as medical NEC.\n\n3. Hematologic:  Complete blood count on admission showed a\nhematocrit of 40.9 with a white count of 15.9.  Platelet\ncount was 294,000.  A differential showed 37 polys and 23\nbands.  The patient received multiple red cell transfusions\nduring the course of [**Month (only) 404**].\n\n4. Infectious Disease:  Because of the patient's marked\nbandemia and the notation of gram-negative rods on initial\nGram stain examination of the amniotic fluid, she was treated\nwith a 10 day course of ampicillin and gentamicin.  This was\nlater changed to cefotaxime because of the presence of\ngram-negative rods.\n\nThe CSF examination done on the fourth day of life showed 0\nwhite cells and 94 red cells.  Blood cultures remained\nnegative during her initial hospital stay as did CSF.\n\n5. Gastrointestinal:  Patient experienced unconjugated\nhyperbilirubinemia.  She was treated with phototherapy.  Her\nmaximum bilirubin was 4.2/0.2 on the second day of life.\n\n6. Neurological:  The patient had a head ultrasound done\nduring the first several days of life.  This demonstrated a\nGrade I interventricular hemorrhage.  A repeat ultrasound\nscan done on the [**12-22**] showed echogenicity of the\ncaudal thalamic groove along with increased echogenicity of\nthe ependymal lining of the trigone.  There was no suggestion\nof changes related to PVL.  Findings were thought to be\nconsistent with a grade [**12-3**] hemorrhage in the left lateral\nventricle.  Ventricular size was normal.  The patient has\nmanifested in age appropriate nonfocal neurological\nexamination during her hospital stay during this month.\n\nDIAGNOSES:\n1. Twenty-four and a half week infant.\n2. Respiratory distress syndrome.\n3. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\n4. Metabolic acidosis.\n5. Hypotension.\n6. Presumed sepsis.\n7. Grade [**12-3**] interventricular hemorrhage.\n\n                                        [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 36142**],\nM.D.50-470\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37102**]\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2123-4-22**]  12:24\nT:  [**2123-4-22**]  12:25\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 45988**]\n\n\n"}, "1": {"hadm_id": "142807", "chartdate": "2123-03-04", "category": "Discharge summary", "text": "Name: [**Known lastname 8451**],GIRL ([**Known firstname 92**])          Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 8452**]\n\nAdmission Date:  [**2122-12-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2123-3-4**]\n\nDate of Birth:   [**2122-12-13**]       Sex:  F\n\nService:\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  ([**2123-1-30**] through [**2123-3-4**] -\nRefer to patient's chart previous discharge summary for\nadditional information on the hospital course).\n\nBaby Girl [**Known lastname **] is currently day of life #79.  Her weight\ntoday is 2,635 gm.  On day of life #78 she transitioned from\na CPAP of 5 cm of water to nasal cannula at 300 cc of flow in\napproximately 35% FIO2.  She is comfortable on this degree of\nsupport.  She remains fluid restricted at 130 cc/kg/day.  She\nis, however, on no diuretics.\n\nFluids, electrolytes and nutrition - As mentioned before, on\nday of life #79, the day prior to discharge her weight is\n2,634 gm.  She had actually been gaining over-adequate\namounts per day.  For this reason she was recently\ntransitioned from PE28 plus ProMod to PE26 on day of life\n#78.\n\nGastrointestinal - Due to remaining on CPAP she has not\nattempted p.o. feedings.  She has been tolerating her feeds\nwell.\n\nHematology - Her most recent hematocrit is 26.8 with a\nreticulocyte count of 6.8.  This was checked on [**2123-2-22**].  She remains on supplemental iron and Vitamin E.\n\nInfectious disease - On day of life #48 she was treated for a\nconjunctivitis, receiving five days of Erythromycin.  She\nstill has some occasional eye discharge but her conjunctiva\nremain clear and she has been receiving massages to the nasal\nlacrimal duct.\n\nNeurologic - Baby [**Known lastname **] had previously had normal head\nultrasound and she is due for a head ultrasound prior to\ndischarge.\n\nOphthalmologic - On day of life #64 at 33 [**1-8**] corrected\ngestational age she had Stage 1 anterior zone 2 retinopathy\nof prematurity.  More recently on day of life #71, putting\nher at 34 2/7 weeks corrected gestational age, her disease\nwas Stage 1, Zone 2 with 6 clock hours bilaterally.

The patient has not been screened for a carseat.\n4.  The state newborn screen most recently was normal.\n5.  She did receive her two month immunizations.\n6.  Immunizations recommended - Synagis respiratory syncytial\nvirus prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 5298**] through\n[**Month (only) **] for infants who meet any of the following three\ncriteria:  1.  Born at less than 32 weeks; 2.  Born between\n32 and 35 weeks with plans for daycare during respiratory\nsyncytial virus season, with a smoker in the household or\nwith preschool siblings; or 3. With chronic lung disease.\nAlso, influenza immunization should be considered annually in\nthe fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once\nthey reach six months of age.  Before this age the family and\nother caregivers should be considered for immunization\nagainst influenza to protect the infant.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:\n1.  Prematurity at 24 weeks\n2.

Please refer to patient chart for\nhistory, physical and hospital course from admission through\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:\n(1) RESPIRATORY:  Haily is a 24-1/7 weeker who was 27-2/7\nweeks at the beginning of the month with significant lung\ndisease and evolving chronic lung disease.  She was on SIMV,\nrelatively high settings at the beginning of the month.  Over\nthe course of the first three days, she was weaned down to\ntransitioned to a CPAP of 7 on [**2123-1-7**] and about 40% to 50%.\nOver the course of the next two weeks, Haily transitioned\ndown to a nasopharyngeal CPAP of 5 with an exception of two\ndays, where chest films showed mild atelectasis on the right\nupper lobe, requiring two days of CPAP of 6.  She is\ncurrently on a CPAP of 5 and 27% to 35%.\n\nHer FIO2 has increased over the course of the last week, most\nlikely secondary to her anemia.  She is not on any diuretic or\nfluid restriction.  She is on caffeine of 7\nmg/kg per day.  She has more recently had apnea of\nprematurity that again is likely associated with her anemia.\n\nThe plan is to transfuse Haily with packed red blood cells\ntoday, and then transition her from CPAP likely to nasal\ncannula over the next few days.\n\n(2) FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, NUTRITION:  I received Haily on a\ntotal fluids of 150 cc/kg per day and mostly PN, as she was\ncompleting a rule-out NEC at the beginning of the month.  On\n[**2123-1-11**], Haily was started on trophic feeds, which she\ntolerated for two days, and a feed advancement was slowly\nundertaken.  By [**2123-1-15**], it was evident that Haily was not\ngoing to have any difficulties with refeeding, and so she was\nprogressed to full feeds and then subsequently progressed to\nincreased calories over the course of the next week.\n\nCurrently, she is on 150 cc/kg per day of PE 30 with ProMod\nq.4 hours over 40 minutes, and she seems to tolerate that\njust fine without any issues.\n\n(3) GI:  Prior to this month's service, there were some\nquestionable abdominal exams with pneumatosis, so Haily was\nstarted on antibiotics and made NPO with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 37079**], for\nwhich she completed a 10-day course of rule out NEC with no\nclinical signs of necrotizing enterocolitis.  The [**Last Name (un) 37079**]\nwas discontinued on [**2123-1-6**] with no clinical change.  Feeds\nwere started as outlined above, and she has been tolerating\nthat with no issues.\n\n(4) HEMATOLOGY:  Haily has anemia of\nprematurity.  She received one transfusion on [**2123-1-12**] with\na mild bump in her hematocrit.  Haily's subsequent hematocrit\nwas 26.6 and a reticulocyte count two weeks after the last\ntransfusion was 1.9.  Epogen was considered but was not\ninstituted.  Because of Haily's mild increasing oxygen\nrequirement and increase in apneas, Haily was given 20 cc/kg\nof packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in two aliquots on\n[**2123-1-29**] with a dose of Lasix in between.  We plan to follow\nher anemia of prematurity clinically subsequently.\n\n(5) I.D.:  Haily completed 10 days of ampicillin and\ngentamicin for her rule out necrotizing enterocolitis on\n[**2123-1-8**].  Clindamycin was not used because necrotizing\nenterocolitis was not supported radiographically.\n\n(6) NEUROLOGIC:  Haily has had normal head ultrasounds in her\nfirst 10 days and subsequently on day of life 30, [**2123-1-12**].\nPlan would be to follow another head ultrasound at 60 days\nand/or prior to discharge, given her clinical status.\n\n(7) OPHTHALMOLOGIC:  Haily had her first ophthalmologic exam\non [**2123-1-26**], was negative for retinopathy of prematurity but\nwas still immature.  Plan to follow up ophthalmologic exam in\ntwo weeks.\n\n(8) SOCIAL:  Parents are involved.  They are\nfrom [**Hospital1 1474**], but when Haily is off CPAP would request a\ntransfer to [**Hospital6 33**] for the duration of her\ncare.  Their pediatrician is undetermined as of yet.\n\n\nReviewed By:  DR.[**Last Name (STitle) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] 50-622\nDictated By:[**First Name3 (LF) 43833**]\n\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2123-1-29**]  15:08\nT:  [**2123-1-31**]  09:48\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 45987**]\n1\n1\n1\nDR\n\n"}, "194": {"hadm_id": "142807", "chartdate": "2123-01-29", "category": "Nursing/other", "text": "NPN:\n\n\n2.

Immediately adjacent to the caudal thalamic groove in the\n periventricular white matter is a focal area of increased echogenicity.  This\n is seen to a much lesser extent on the contralateral right side.  This may\n represent prominent white matter tracts as this does not seem to have any mass\n effect on the adjacent lateral ventricle.  Alternatively, this may represent\n an early intraventricular hemorrhage.  This was discussed in detail with the\n clinical team.  Periventricular white matter is otherwise normal.  No extra-\n axial collections.  No structural abnormalities are seen.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n Left grade I germinal matrix hemorrhage.  Focal area of increased echogenicity\n in the left periventricular white matter, immediately adjacent to the germinal\n matrix of uncertain significance.
