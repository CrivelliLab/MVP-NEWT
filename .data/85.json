No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.\nThere are no acute osseous abnormalities.\nIMPRESSION:\nStreaky bibasilar opacities, which could reflect atelectasis\nthough infection cannot be completely excluded.\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n76 yo Male with hx of AVR, CAD s/p CABG, MDS- pancyopenia,\nnon-hodgkins lymphoma, and Parkinson's who was relaeased from\nthe hospital 2 months ago for a pneumonia who returns with a\nHCAP and new a. fib w/ rvr. Was treated in the ICU and\ntransferred to the floor to complete 10 day course of\nantibiotics.\n\n1) HCAP pneumonia/sepsis- Pt initially sirs criteria, and\npresented with dry cough x2 weeks, new weakness, and his CXR was\nconcerning for a new RLL inflitate. With the pt's history of\nParkinson's disease, was at risk for aspiration due to\ndysphagia, and thus cause recurrent pneumonia. Pt's fever curve\nimproved with vancomycin, cefepime and azithromycin for a 10 day\ncourse (through [**2167-8-6**]). Blood cultures were negative. Pt's dry\ncough did not improve with cough syrup, tessalon perles and\nnebulizer treatments and thus had an ENT consult which found\nmild irritation of vocal cords most likely related to acid\nreflux or viral infection. Laryngoscopy did not show vocal cord\nparalysis and structurally normal. Cough mildly improved while\non the floor, but still with significant cough at discharge. He\nwas started on prednisone 40 mg PO daily for a 4 day total\ncourse to end on [**2167-8-2**].\n\n2) New Atrial fib w/ rvr in 120s likely due to stress of\nincreasing cardic output in septic picture. Other concerns\nincluded his thyroid medicine and new ischemia but TSH normal\nand cardiac enzymes were negative. Pt was rate controlled with\nmetoprolol 50mg TID and was successfully converted to NS rhythm.\nEcho was done which showed LVEF>55%, no thrombus. Pt's CHADS2\nscore at 1. Aspirin was held due to thrombocytopenia.\nMetoprolol was discontinued given his reactive airways and\nwheezing. On stopping, patient tended to be borderline\ntachyardia with intermittent atrial fibrillation and bigeminal\nPACs. When his pulmonary symptoms resolve, metoprolol should be\nconsidered if his tachycardia/afib persists at rehab.\n\n3) Parkinson's disease: Was continued on home pramipexole during\ncourse and was evaluated by speech and swallow for dysphagia; pt\nwas cleared for regular solid PO intake.\n\n4) MDS/Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: s/p chemo and BMT, chronic\nthrombocytopenia. Pt had no bleeding issues.  Patient required\ntransfusion of 1 unit of platelets prior to PICC line placement\nbut otherwised remained above transfusion threshold without\nevidence of bleeding.\n\n5) Hyperlipidemia: Rosuvastatin was continued throughout course.\n\n6) BPH: Tamsulosin was continued throughout course.\n\n7) Depression/Anxiety: Stable, PRN diazepam. Was requiring\napproximately one additional dose of diazepam daily.\n\n8) Hypothyroid: continue home Levothyroxine Sodium 50 mcg PO\nDAILY. TSH normal.\n\n9) Left ear ceurmen: Stable.\n\n10) Constipation: Continued Lactulose, Polyethylene Glycol,\nDocusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID, and Senna 1 TAB PO BID.\n\n# Transitional issues:\n- Consider starting patient on metoprolol for new atrial\nfibrillation, was started in house, then discontinued given\nreactive airways.  Should be restarted if he continues to have\ntachycardia/afib once pulm symptoms resolve.\n- Patient should continue full treatment for HCAP with\nvancomycin 1g IV Q12 and Cefepime 2 g IV Q12H through is PICC\nline, both through [**2167-8-6**].\n- PICC line okay to use by nursing staff at rehab. CXR confirmed\nplacement on [**7-29**] and has been used here.\n- Patient started on prednisone 40 mg PO daily for reactive\nairways, which should continue through [**8-2**].\n- Patient started on high dose PPI while in house given ENT\nevaluation of laryngeal inflammation from possible reflux.  This\nshould be discussed with PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 31042**] in 2 weeks.\nContinued high dose PPI has multiple risks and these should be\nweighed.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete.\nInformation was obtained from  Record.\n1.

Cardiac cath revealed severe aortic stenosis along with\n2 vessel coronary artery disease and a dilated ascending aorta.\nHe was then referred for surgical evaluation. [**Date Range **] all\npre-operative testing and was brought to the operating room on\n[**2162-3-3**]. He [**Date Range 1834**] an Aortic Valve Replacement, Asc. Aorta\nReplacement, and Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 2. Please see\noperative report for surgical details. He did have significant\namount of post-op bleeding that required multiple blood\nproducts. Following surgery he was transferred to the CSRU for\ninvasive monitoring in stable condition.  Within 24 hours he was\nweaned from sedation awoke neurologically intact and extubated.\nOn post-op day one there appeared to be left arm edema with\nbluish discoloration and left-sided neck bulge. All left arm\nperipheral IV's and arterial line were removed, vascular surgery\nwas consulted and an upper extremity ultrasound was performed.\nUltrasound was negative for DVT. His chest tubes and epicardial\npacing wires were removed per protocol. Diuretics and\nbeta-blockers were initiated and he was gently diuresed towards\nhis pre-op weight. On post-op day two he was transferred to the\ntelemetry floor. He continued to improve post-operatively and\nworked with PT for strength and mobility. Left arm swelling and\nneck bulge has resolved.  Clinically he appeared to be doing\nwell but needed additional PT and was discharged to rehab\nfacility on post-op day seven.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nPrimidone 150mg qhs, Mirapex 0.5mg TID, Diazepam 4mg [**Hospital1 **],\nZyprexa 5mg qhs, Omeprazole 20mg prn\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n\nFacility:\n[**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Nursing Home - [**Location (un) **]\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nAortic Stenosis, Asc.

Suboptimal study. Target HR not achieved.\n\nConclusions:\n\n\nThe patient exercised for 0 minutes 46 seconds according to an modified\n[**Doctor Last Name 21**] treadmill protocol reaching a peak heart rate of 121 bpm. After 46\nseconds, his BP dropped to from 110/70 at rest to 98/70 mmHg and the test was\nstopped because of this hypotensive response. This level of exercise\nrepresents a very poor exercise tolerance for age. In response to stress, the\nECG showed no ST-T wave changes (see exercise report for details). There was a\nnormal heart rate response to exercise. The blood pressure response to stress\nwas abnormal/hypotensive.\nResting images were acquired at a heart rate of 101 bpm and a blood pressure\nof 110/70 mmHg. These demonstrated normal regional and global left ventricular\nsystolic function. Doppler demonstrated severe aortic stenonsis and no aortic\nregurgitation with no significant mitral regurgitation or resting LVOT\ngradient.\nEcho images were acquired within 46 seconds after peak stress at heart rates\nof 115-104 bpm. These demonstrated appropriate augmentation of all left\nventricular segments with slight decrease in cavity size. There was\naugmentation of right ventricular free wall motion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Very poor functional exercise capacity. No ischemic ECG changes\nand no 2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved\nworkload. Severe aortic stenosis at rest. Hypotensive response to exercise.\nSuboptimal study. Target HR not achieved.\n\n\n"}}
